### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software automation engineer and gamer who writes modding tools for Super Smash Bros. Melee, and some other GameCube & Wii games. I wrote DAT Texture Wizard, the Melee Code Manager, and a few other smaller tools. I'm currently working on an update to 20XX HP, and a project to combine DTW and MCM into a single, more powerful tool which can do what they both can and a whole lot more (including much better code injection technology). If you'd like to support my work, please consider joining me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/drgn).
