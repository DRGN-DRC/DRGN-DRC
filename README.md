### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software automation engineer and gamer who writes modding tools for Super Smash Bros. Melee, and some other GameCube & Wii games. I wrote DAT Texture Wizard, the Melee Code Manager, and many other smaller tools. I'm currently working on a program that's a combination of DTW and MCM: The Melee Modding Wizard. It's a much more powerful tool that does what they both can and a whole lot more (including much better code injection technology and model previews). Feel free to reach out to me on Discord in the Melee Workshop if you'd like to help contribute to this. Or if you'd like to support my work, please consider joining me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/drgn)!
